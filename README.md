# Task-5
Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark

 - What is Wireshark 
   - Its a **Network protocol analyzer** primarily used for capturing and examining data packets on network

I browsed a website and ping the same website to show the traffic

we can see TCP, DNS, ICMP and other protocol in the wireshaek 

In the analyzise we can see some protocol that we said earlier. icmp is looking that the site is active or not and we can see that it is active. we see DNS, TCP and http protocols as well as in the analyzis
